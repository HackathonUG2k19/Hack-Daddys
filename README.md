  <ul>
    <li>If you wish to bid on a particular article, navigate to it and click on the bid button. This will prompt you to set           your bid amount (minimum is previous bid + minimum increment) and await updates on the article.</li>
    <li>Every article will be present on the site for a maximum of 7 days, after which the article will be locked for sale to         the highest bidder. The seller will be provided with the contact details of the highest bidder, and the transaction           is not handled by the website.</li>
    <li>To sell items, navigate to your home page and fill in all the required details. Ensure that ample details are                 provided to warrant bids from interested buyers.</li>
    <li>Do not set up unrealistic bids to deter other bidders. If multiple sellers report sales that don't go through, you           will be blacklisted from the site.</li>
  
  </ul>
