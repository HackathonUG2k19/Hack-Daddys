      <li>Navbar</li>
      <li>An image slider with the current 'hottest deals'</li>
      <li>Sign in/ Sign up page access </li>

      <li>IF SIGNED IN: Page to add a stake/ Page to add a sellable item</li>
      <li>We need email verification, to ensure if it's a IIIT student</li>
      <li>Also E-mail updates</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><h4>RANDOM THOUGHTS</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>All auctioned items need an expiration time, can't be on the website indefinitely</li>
      <li>Auction site takes 10% cut, need to have a fine print terms and conditions</li>
      <li>The items page should show the description and the details of the item when you hover over it (If possible)</li>
      <li>Sign up - Email (college verified), name (also verify?), age(18+ only)</li>
      <li>After sign in, splash welcome?</li>
      <li>Or take you to a personalized homepage which has updates on your items for sales, and if stakes you placed have been outbid</li>
      <li>We need to encrypt data right? (Can i work on encryption?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
